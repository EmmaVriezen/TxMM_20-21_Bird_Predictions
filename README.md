# Text and Multimedia Mining 20-21: Bird Predictions
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook files used for my individual project for the course [Text and Multimedia Mining at Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/courseguides/socsci/courses-osiris/ai/let-rema-lcex06-text-multimedia-mining/).
This README contains a short description for what happens in each of the .ipynb files, and a summary of the contents of the other files.
First however, the resources used within this project are listed:
* [Microsoft AI for Earth](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth-tech-resources): the Species Classification API is trained to recognise over 5000 species. It can be used after requesting a key. The species classification in this project is done by this API.
* [Waarneming.nl](https://waarneming.nl/): everyone can upload observations of any species seen in the Netherlands to this website. There is also an international version. The images used in this project were taken from this website.
